      <p>Hi!  My name is Markus Schiffer. I just finished my first year at the University of Washington. I really enjoyed the exprience, and I was fortuante to attend a university that is so close to home.</p>
      <h3>Here are some of my favorite things:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>My favorite color is <span class="highlight">orange</span>.</li>
        <li>My favorite TV show is <span class="highlight">Prison Break</span>.</li>
        <li>My favorite food is <span class="highlight">Pizza</span>. You can never go wrong with <span class="highlight">Pizza</span>.</li>
        <li>My favorite soda is <span class="highlight">Fanta</span>.</li>
        <li>My favorite video game is actually the whole original <span class="highlight">Mass Effect trilogy</span>.</li>
        <li>My favorite movie is the <span class="highlight">original Blues Brothers</span>.</li>
        <li>My favorite musician (this changes a lot) right now is <span class="highlight">Yelawolf</span>.</li>

      <p>I hope to one day be a manager at a big tech company. That's a large part of the reason that I am taking HTML5 100. This summer I chose to be a lot more productive than in previous summers. I have commited to furthering both my education and physical health by taking classes and working out almost every day.</p>
