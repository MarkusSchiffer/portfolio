      <p>Hi!  My name is Markus Schiffer. I just finished my first year at the University of Washington. I really enjoyed the exprience, and I was fortuante to attend a university that is so close to home.</p>
      <h3>Here are some of my favorite things:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>My favorite color is orange.</li>
        <li>My favorite TV show is Prison Break.</li>
        <li>My favorite food is Pizza. You can never go wrong with Pizza.</li>
        <li>My favorite soda is Fanta.</li>
        <li>My favorite video game is actually the whole original Mass Effect trilogy.</li>
        <li>My favorite movie is the original Blues Brothers.</li>
        <li>My favorite musician (this changes a lot) right now is Yelawolf.</li>
        <li>My favorite super hero is Batman.</li>
        <li>My favorite sport is soccer. I like to root for the German National Team when they play.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I hope to one day be a manager at a big tech company. That's a large part of the reason that I am taking HTML5 100. This summer I chose to be a lot more productive than in previous summers. I have commited to furthering both my education and physical health by taking classes and working out almost every day.</p>
